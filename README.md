# setupsRepo
In this repo I test how to manage a repo that contains all the information about the setups.

# how to use the setup

# How this repo is structured.
for each setup there is:
- a readme file that contains:
   - Brief overview of the setup
   - link or name of the configuration files folder
- doc folder:
  - wiring
  - Bom mec
- Diary of particular changes  : currently the diary is implemented as an issue that will be open always where evryone who use the setup can write down the changes upported to the setup and if he/she need for more days. In this way it should be smart update the changes and notify if someone need for more days the setupo and other people cannot touch them.

# Available setup
