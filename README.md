# setupsRepo

In this repository, I experiment with managing a repo that contains all information related to different setups.

## How to use this repository

1. Choose the setup you are interested in from the list of available setups.
2. Refer to the dedicated `README.md` for each setup, which provides an overview and links to configuration files.
3. Check the `doc` folder for technical details such as wiring diagrams and mechanical BOMs.
4. To track changes, refer to the dedicated “diary” issue, which is always open. Anyone using the setup can note changes made and the reasons for them.

## Repository structure

Each setup includes:

- **README:**  
  A brief overview and a link or reference to the configuration files folder.
- **`doc` folder:**  
  Contains:
  - Wiring diagrams
  - Mechanical Bill of Materials (BOM)
- **Change Diary:**  
  Currently implemented as an always-open issue, where users can document modifications, motivations, and also book the setup for exclusive use.

## Change Diary

Each setup has a “Change Diary,” which serves as a collaborative log of all modifications, updates, or improvements made over time. Currently, the diary is implemented as a dedicated GitHub Issue that remains open and accessible to all collaborators and users of the setup.

**How to use the Change Diary:**

- Whenever you make a change to a setup—such as hardware modifications, configuration updates, or bug fixes—add a comment to the corresponding Change Diary issue.
- In your comment, please include:
  - **Date of the change**
  - **Description of the modification** (what was changed and why)
  - **Author** (your GitHub username) (if different from who wrote the comment)
  - **Related files or documentation**, if applicable (provide links if possible)

- The Change Diary also serves as a booking system:
  If you need to use a particular setup for several days (for experiments, testing, or maintenance), you can "book" it by leaving a comment specifying the dates you will use the setup. This way, others know not to use or modify the setup during that period.

- The Change Diary helps keep track of the setup’s evolution, fosters transparency, and allows all collaborators to stay informed about its history.
- Before making new changes or using a setup, consult the Change Diary to understand recent updates, reservations, and avoid conflicts or duplicated efforts.
